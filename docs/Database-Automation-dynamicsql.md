## Section 2: Dynamic SQL / incorporate data variable

Inborn within Nexial is the flexibility to construct "things" - more specifically, test data - 
dynamically.  We will have a separate tutorial dedicated to that topic.  For now, we want to
explore the possibility of constructing SQL query dynamically so that:
- our automation can react accordingly to external controls
- our automation can be reusable - like a template - towards multiple similar scenarios
- one automation can integrate with other another automation script by utilizing the same
data variables

Let's see some examples:

#### Example 1: Parameterizing SQL

#### Example 2: Just-in-time WHERE clause construction

#### Example 3: Dynamic SELECT clause 

There's a much more powerful way to generate dynamic SQL using Nexial Expression.  We will cover 
this in a later tutorial.
